// This module defines a styled component (Wrap) using the @emotion/styled library.
// The purpose of this styled component is to create a flex container with specific styles.
// It ensures that the container displays its children in a flex layout with a gap of 8px between them, and it pushes the content to the right by setting the left margin to 'auto'.
// This styled component can be used for layout purposes within a larger component or application.
